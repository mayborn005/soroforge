// The history is the point of the tool: it answers "which WASM hash is live on
// which network, and who put it there" long after the terminal that ran the
// deploy is gone. Two tables back that — contracts holds current state, and
// deployments is an append-only log of every deploy, upgrade, and upload.
//
// Everything is namespaced by network. A contract alias means nothing on its
// own; "counter on testnet" and "counter on mainnet" are separate records with
// separate lifecycles, and no query in this package crosses that boundary
// implicitly.
//
// The history is append-only: every on-chain change to a tracked contract —
// deploy, upgrade, upload, TTL extension, or restore — is a row, and the rows
// for one contract are its lifecycle log.
